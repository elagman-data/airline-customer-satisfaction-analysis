# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis
**Industry:** Aviation | Customer Analytics | Data Analysis

---

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction using a large-scale survey dataset
containing **over 100,000 responses**. The objective is to identify key **service, operational,
and customer experience factors** that influence whether passengers report being satisfied
or dissatisfied.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to uncover patterns across
customer segments, service quality ratings, cabin classes, and delay categories.
Results indicate that **service experience and operational performance** play a more
significant role in satisfaction outcomes than passenger demographics alone.

This project was completed as part of a **group academic assignment**, with this repository
documenting **my individual analytical contributions**.

## Business Questions
- Which service and operational factors most strongly influence airline customer satisfaction?
- How does satisfaction vary across customer segments and travel classes?
- What is the impact of departure and arrival delays on passenger satisfaction?

---

## My Role & Contributions
I was primarily responsible for developing and analyzing **Sections 4.1 to 5.3** of the notebook,
which focus on exploratory data analysis and interpretation of customer satisfaction patterns.

My contributions included:
- Designing and executing EDA to identify key satisfaction drivers
- Performing distribution and correlation analysis of service quality and operational variables
- Creating and interpreting visualizations comparing satisfaction across customer segments
- Collaborating with a teammate on selected visualizations in later sections
- Debugging, validating results, and contributing to documentation and insights

All analyses included in this repository reflect components that I actively worked on
and can confidently explain.

## Methodology
- Loaded and prepared survey data using **pandas** and **numpy**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis including:
  - Distribution analysis (histograms and box plots)
  - Correlation analysis (heatmaps)
  - Segment comparisons across customer type, cabin class, and delay categories
- Visualized insights using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**

The analysis is **descriptive and exploratory** in nature and does not include
predictive or machine learning models.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Python:** pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** exploratory analysis and reporting
- **Data Analysis:** EDA, segmentation, correlation analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Service experience variables such as **online boarding, inflight entertainment,
  seat comfort, and travel class** show the strongest association with passenger satisfaction.
- Longer departure and arrival delays significantly increase dissatisfaction,
  particularly beyond **30 minutes**.
- Passenger demographics alone are less influential than **service quality and
  operational performance** in determining satisfaction outcomes.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritize improvements in high-impact service features that strongly correlate with satisfaction.
- Reduce and better manage flight delays to improve overall passenger experience.
- Focus on operational and service improvements rather than demographic targeting alone.

---

## Next Steps
- Develop a classification model to predict passenger satisfaction outcomes.
- Quantify feature importance using supervised learning techniques.
- Extend the analysis to airline-level or route-level comparisons.
